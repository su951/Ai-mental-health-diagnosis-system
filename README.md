AI-Powered Mental Health Diagnosis System 🌟
An AI-driven platform to help users self-assess mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and loneliness through a private, user-friendly interface.
📌 Project Overview

This system leverages **machine learning models** (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to analyze user responses to yes/no questions and provide insights into their mental well-being. Built with Python and Streamlit, it aims to reduce the stigma around mental health by offering a confidential first step toward awareness.

### Key Features:
- **Private & Anonymous**: No personal data required.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest for accurate predictions.
- **Accessible**: Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for global access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple yes/no questionnaire format.
